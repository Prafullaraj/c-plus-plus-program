Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space.

Example :

Input :

[1, 10, 5]
Output :

5 
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

You may assume that all the elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.

You may also assume that the difference will not overflow.

struct Solution {
  int maximumGap(vector<int> &A) {
      /* write your solution here */
      int n=A.size();
      int i,max=0;
      sort(A.begin(),A.end());
      for(i=0;i<n-1;i++)
      {
          int y=A[i+1]-A[i];
          if(y>max)
          {
          max=y;
          }
      }
      return max;
  }
};
